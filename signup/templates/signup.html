<p id="p1">It&#8217;s <strong>very clear</strong> to everyone now that we need to do something to prevent climate change. But what do we do?</p> 

<p id="p2">To one side we're being told that so long as we change to energy saving light bulbs and turn off our phone chargers we'll be okay - a nice start, but we need more than that. On the other side we've got people who think we need to end our current civilisation as we know it - no more travel, no more enjoyable goods, no more communication - this can't be a good idea. Add to that the current global financial crisis - surely we can't manage all of this at once?</p>


<p id="p11">But that's exactly what we're campaigning for - SERIOUS CHANGE that will both save the climate, our lifestyles, and <strong>the economy</strong>!</p>

<p id="p3">To keep the civilisation we've built, we need a secure climate to live in and secure energy to power everything around us. We need solutions that add up, and actions to be taken <strong>now</strong>. Whilst personal actions are good, it requires <strong>governmental action</strong> to provide the economic environment to make this work, and to kick start the low-carbon economy in this country. Then the private sector can get to creating new solutions (thus creating much needed jobs).

	<p>By taking a lead in becoming a low-carbon economy we'll be securing our country's future.</p>
  
  <p>That's why we've set up SERIOUS CHANGE - to provide pressure to make sure that government does not ignore the issues, the evidence, and the advice out there. We want the government to focus on a low-carbon agenda as both a way to <strong>solve our environmental plight tomorrow and our economical plight today</strong>	.</p>
